# This is the Dendrite configuration file.
#
# The configuration is split up into sections - each Dendrite component has a
# configuration section, in addition to the "global" section which applies to
# all components.
#
# At a minimum, to get started, you will need to update the settings in the
# "global" section for your deployment, and you will need to check that the
# database "connection_string" line in each component section is correct. 
#
# Each component with a "database" section can accept the following formats
# for "connection_string":
#   SQLite:     file:filename.db
#               file:///path/to/filename.db
#   PostgreSQL: postgresql://user:pass@hostname/database?params=...
#
# SQLite is embedded into Dendrite and therefore no further prerequisites are
# needed for the database when using SQLite mode. However, performance with
# PostgreSQL is significantly better and recommended for multi-user deployments.
# SQLite is typically around 20-30% slower than PostgreSQL when tested with a
# small number of users and likely will perform worse still with a higher volume
# of users.
#
# The "max_open_conns" and "max_idle_conns" settings configure the maximum 
# number of open/idle database connections. The value 0 will use the database
# engine default, and a negative value will use unlimited connections. The
# "conn_max_lifetime" option controls the maximum length of time a database
# connection can be idle in seconds - a negative value is unlimited.
