### Background information

### Description

- **What** is the problem:
- **Who** is affected:
- **How** is this bug manifesting:
- **When** did this first appear:

<!--
Examples of good descriptions:
- What: "I cannot log in, getting HTTP 500 responses"
- Who: "Clients on my server"
- How: "Errors in the logs saying 500 internal server error"
- When: "After upgrading to 0.3.0"

- What: "Dendrite ran out of memory"
- Who: "Server admin"
- How: "Lots of logs about device change updates"
- When: "After my server joined Matrix HQ"

Examples of bad descriptions:
- What: "Can't send messages"  - This is bad because it isn't specfic enough. Which endpoint isn't working and what is the response code? Does the message send but encryption fail?
- Who: "Me" - Who are you? Running the server or a user on a Dendrite server?
- How: "Can't send messages" - Same as "What".
- When: "1 day ago" - It's impossible to know what changed 1 day ago without further input.
