# Changelog

## Dendrite 0.2.0 (2020-10-20)

### Important

* This release makes breaking changes for polylith deployments, since they now use the multi-personality binary rather than separate binary files
  * Users of polylith deployments should revise their setups to use the new binary - see the Features section below
* This release also makes breaking changes for Docker deployments, as are now publishing images to Docker Hub in separate repositories for monolith and polylith
  * New repositories are as follows: [matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith) and [matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith)
  * The new `latest` tag will be updated with the latest release, and new versioned tags, e.g. `v0.2.0`, will preserve specific release versions
  * [Sample Compose configs](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/tree/master/build/docker) have been updated - if you are running a Docker deployment, please review the changes
  * Images for the client API proxy and federation API proxy are no longer provided as they are unsupported - please use [nginx](docs/nginx/) (or another reverse proxy) instead

### Features

* Dendrite polylith deployments now use a special multi-personality binary, rather than separate binaries
  * This is cleaner, builds faster and simplifies deployment
  * The first command line argument states the component to run, e.g. `./dendrite-polylith-multi roomserver`
* Database migrations are now run at startup
* Invalid UTF-8 in requests is now rejected (contributed by [Pestdoktor](https://github.com/Pestdoktor))
* Fully read markers are now implemented in the client API (contributed by [Lesterpig](https://github.com/Lesterpig))
* Missing auth events are now retrieved from other servers in the room, rather than just the event origin
* `m.room.create` events are now validated properly when processing a `/send_join` response
* The roomserver now implements `KindOld` for handling historic events without them becoming forward extremity candidates, i.e. for backfilled or missing events

### Fixes

* State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically when dealing with large state sets
* The roomserver no longer processes outlier events if they are already known
* A SQLite locking issue in the previous events updater has been fixed
* The client API `/state` endpoint now correctly returns state after the leave event, if the user has left the room
* The client API `/createRoom` endpoint now sends cumulative state to the roomserver for the initial room events
* The federation API `/send` endpoint now correctly requests the entire room state from the roomserver when needed
* Some internal HTTP API paths have been fixed in the user API (contributed by [S7evinK](https://github.com/S7evinK))
* A race condition in the rate limiting code resulting in concurrent map writes has been fixed
* Each component now correctly starts a consumer/producer connection in monolith mode (when using Kafka)
* State resolution is no longer run for single trusted state snapshots that have been verified before
* A crash when rolling back the transaction in the latest events updater has been fixed
* Typing events are now ignored when the sender domain does not match the origin server
* Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors
* Recursion has been removed from the code path for retrieving missing events
* `QueryMissingAuthPrevEvents` now returns events that have no associated state as if they are missing
* Signing key fetchers no longer ignore keys for the local domain, if retrieving a key that is not known in the local config
* Federation timeouts have been adjusted so we don't give up on remote requests so quickly
* `create-account` no longer relies on the device database (contributed by [ThatNerdyPikachu](https://github.com/ThatNerdyPikachu))

### Known issues

* Old events can incorrectly appear in `/sync` as if they are new when retrieving missing events from federated servers, causing them to appear at the bottom of the timeline in clients
