* Dendrite will now use a native SQLite port when building with `CGO_ENABLED=0`
* A number of `thirdparty` endpoints have been added, improving support for appservices

### Fixes

* The `"state"` section of the `/sync` response is no longer limited, so state events should not be dropped unexpectedly
* The deduplication of the `"timeline"` and `"state"` sections in `/sync` is now performed after applying history visibility, so state events should not be dropped unexpectedly
* The `prev_batch` token returned by `/sync` is now calculated after applying history visibility, so that the pagination boundaries are correct
* The room summary membership counts in `/sync` should now be calculated properly in more cases
* A false membership leave event should no longer be sent down `/sync` as a result of retiring an accepted invite (contributed by [tak-hntlabs](https://github.com/tak-hntlabs))

* A bug which could cause a panic when converting events into the `ClientEvent` format has been fixed

## Dendrite 0.10.6 (2022-11-01)

### Features

* History visibility checks have been optimised, which should speed up response times on a variety of endpoints (including `/sync`, `/messages`, `/context` and others) and reduce database load
* The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.9.4
* Some other minor dependencies have been updated

### Fixes

* A panic has been fixed in the sync API PDU stream which could cause requests to fail
* The `/members` response now contains the `room_id` field, which may fix some E2EE problems with clients using the JS SDK (contributed by [ashkitten](https://github.com/ashkitten))
* The auth difference calculation in state resolution v2 has been tweaked for clarity (and moved into gomatrixserverlib with the rest of the state resolution code)

## Dendrite 0.10.5 (2022-10-31)

### Features

* It is now possible to use hCaptcha instead of reCAPTCHA for protecting registration
* A new `auto_join_rooms` configuration option has been added for automatically joining new users to a set of rooms

### Fixes

* Querying cross-signing keys for users should now be considerably faster
* A bug in state resolution where some events were not correctly selected for third-party invites has been fixed
* A bug in state resolution which could result in `not in room` event rejections has been fixed

## Dendrite 0.10.4 (2022-10-21)

### Features

* Various tables belonging to the user API will be renamed so that they are namespaced with the `userapi_` prefix
  * Note that, after upgrading to this version, you should not revert to an older version of Dendrite as the database changes **will not** be reverted automatically

## Dendrite 0.10.2 (2022-10-07)

### Features

* Dendrite will now fail to start if there is an obvious problem with the configured `max_open_conns` when using PostgreSQL database backends, since this can lead to instability and performance issues
  * More information on this is available [in the documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/installation/start/optimisation#postgresql-connection-limit)
* Unnecessary/empty fields will no longer be sent in `/sync` responses
* It is now possible to configure `old_private_keys` from previous Matrix installations on the same domain if only public key is known, to make it easier to expire old keys correctly
  * You can configure either just the `private_key` path, or you can supply both the `public_key` and `key_id`

### Fixes

* The sync transaction behaviour has been modified further so that errors in one stream should not propagate to other streams unnecessarily
* Rooms should now be classified as DM rooms correctly by passing through `is_direct` and unsigned hints
* A bug which caused marking device lists as stale to consume lots of CPU has been fixed
* Users accepting invites should no longer cause unnecessary federated joins if there are already other local users in the room
* The sync API state range queries have been optimised by adding missing indexes

## Dendrite 0.10.1 (2022-09-30)

### Features

* The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.9.2

### Fixes

  * The search index is stored on the filesystem rather than the sync API database, so a path to a suitable storage location on disk must be configured
* Sync requests should now complete faster and use considerably less database connections as a result of better transactional isolation
* The notifications code has been refactored to hopefully make notifications more reliable
* A new `/_dendrite/admin/refreshDevices/{userID}` admin endpoint has been added for forcing a refresh of a remote user's device lists without having to modify the database by hand
* A new `/_dendrite/admin/fulltext/reindex` admin endpoint has been added for rebuilding the search index (although this may take some time)

## Dendrite 0.9.9 (2022-09-22)

### Features

* Dendrite will now try to keep HTTP connections open to remote federated servers for a few minutes after a request and attempt to reuse those connections where possible
  * This should reduce the amount of time spent on TLS handshakes and often speed up requests to remote servers
  * This new behaviour can be disabled with the `federation_api.disable_http_keepalives` option if needed

## Dendrite 0.8.3 (2022-05-09)

### Features

* Open registration is now harder to enable, which should reduce the chance that Dendrite servers will be used to conduct spam or abuse attacks
  * Dendrite will only enable open registration if you pass the `--really-enable-open-registration` command line flag at startup
  * If open registration is enabled but this command line flag is not passed, Dendrite will fail to start up
* Dendrite now supports phone-home statistic reporting
  * These statistics include things like the number of registered and active users, some configuration options and platform/environment details, to help us to understand how Dendrite is used
  * This is not enabled by default — it must be enabled in the `global.report_stats` section of the config file
* Monolith installations can now be configured with a single global database connection pool (in `global.database` in the config) rather than having to configure each component separately
  * This also means that you no longer need to balance connection counts between different components, as they will share the same larger pool
  * Specific components can override the global database settings by specifying their own `database` block
  * To use only the global pool, you must configure `global.database` and then remove the `database` block from all of the component sections of the config file
* A new admin API endpoint `/_dendrite/admin/evacuateRoom/{roomID}` has been added, allowing server admins to forcefully part all local users from a given room
* The sync notifier now only loads members for the relevant rooms, which should reduce CPU usage and load on the database
* A number of component interfaces have been refactored for cleanliness and developer ease
* Event auth errors in the log should now be much more useful, including the reason for the event failures
* The forward extremity calculation in the roomserver has been simplified
* A new index has been added to the one-time keys table in the keyserver which should speed up key count lookups

* The media `/config` endpoint will no longer return a maximum upload size field if it is configured to be unlimited in the Dendrite config
* The server notices room will no longer produce "User is already joined to the room" errors
* Consumer errors will no longer flood the logs during a graceful shutdown
* Sync API and federation API consumers will no longer unnecessarily query added state events matching the one in the output event
* The Sync API will no longer unnecessarily track invites for remote users

* Filtering has been added to the `/messages` endpoint
* The room summary now contains "heroes" (up to 5 users in the room) for clients to display when no room name is set
* The existing lazy-loading caches will now be used by `/messages` and `/context` so that member events will not be sent to clients more times than necessary
* The account data stream now uses the provided filters
* The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.0
* The `/state` and `/state_ids` endpoints will now return `M_NOT_FOUND` for rejected events

### Fixes

* Fictitious presence updates will no longer be created for users which have not sent us presence updates, which should speed up complete syncs considerably
* Uploading cross-signing device signatures should now be more reliable, fixing a number of bugs with cross-signing
* All account data should now be sent properly on a complete sync, which should eliminate problems with client settings or key backups appearing to be missing
* Account data will now be limited correctly on incremental syncs, returning the stream position of the most recent update rather than the latest stream position
* Account data will not be sent for parted rooms, which should reduce the number of left/forgotten rooms reappearing in clients as empty rooms
* The TURN username hash has been fixed which should help to resolve some problems when using TURN for voice calls (contributed by [fcwoknhenuxdfiyv](https://github.com/fcwoknhenuxdfiyv))
* Push rules can no longer be modified using the account data endpoints
* Querying account availability should now work properly in polylith deployments
* A number of bugs with sync filters have been fixed
* A default sync filter will now be used if the request contains a filter ID that does not exist
* The `pushkey_ts` field is now using seconds instead of milliseconds
* A race condition when gracefully shutting down has been fixed, so JetStream should no longer cause the process to exit before other Dendrite components are finished shutting down

* This release makes breaking changes for polylith deployments, since they now use the multi-personality binary rather than separate binary files
  * Users of polylith deployments should revise their setups to use the new binary - see the Features section below
* This release also makes breaking changes for Docker deployments, as are now publishing images to Docker Hub in separate repositories for monolith and polylith
  * New repositories are as follows: [matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith) and [matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith)
  * The new `latest` tag will be updated with the latest release, and new versioned tags, e.g. `v0.2.0`, will preserve specific release versions
  * [Sample Compose configs](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/tree/master/build/docker) have been updated - if you are running a Docker deployment, please review the changes
  * Images for the client API proxy and federation API proxy are no longer provided as they are unsupported - please use [nginx](docs/nginx/) (or another reverse proxy) instead

### Features

* Dendrite polylith deployments now use a special multi-personality binary, rather than separate binaries
  * This is cleaner, builds faster and simplifies deployment
  * The first command line argument states the component to run, e.g. `./dendrite-polylith-multi roomserver`
* Database migrations are now run at startup
* Invalid UTF-8 in requests is now rejected (contributed by [Pestdoktor](https://github.com/Pestdoktor))
* Fully read markers are now implemented in the client API (contributed by [Lesterpig](https://github.com/Lesterpig))
* Missing auth events are now retrieved from other servers in the room, rather than just the event origin
* `m.room.create` events are now validated properly when processing a `/send_join` response
* The roomserver now implements `KindOld` for handling historic events without them becoming forward extremity candidates, i.e. for backfilled or missing events

### Fixes

* State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically when dealing with large state sets
* The roomserver no longer processes outlier events if they are already known
* A SQLite locking issue in the previous events updater has been fixed
* The client API `/state` endpoint now correctly returns state after the leave event, if the user has left the room
* The client API `/createRoom` endpoint now sends cumulative state to the roomserver for the initial room events
* The federation API `/send` endpoint now correctly requests the entire room state from the roomserver when needed
* Some internal HTTP API paths have been fixed in the user API (contributed by [S7evinK](https://github.com/S7evinK))
* A race condition in the rate limiting code resulting in concurrent map writes has been fixed
* Each component now correctly starts a consumer/producer connection in monolith mode (when using Kafka)
* State resolution is no longer run for single trusted state snapshots that have been verified before
* A crash when rolling back the transaction in the latest events updater has been fixed
* Typing events are now ignored when the sender domain does not match the origin server
* Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors
* Recursion has been removed from the code path for retrieving missing events
* `QueryMissingAuthPrevEvents` now returns events that have no associated state as if they are missing
* Signing key fetchers no longer ignore keys for the local domain, if retrieving a key that is not known in the local config
* Federation timeouts have been adjusted so we don't give up on remote requests so quickly
* `create-account` no longer relies on the device database (contributed by [ThatNerdyPikachu](https://github.com/ThatNerdyPikachu))

### Known issues

* Old events can incorrectly appear in `/sync` as if they are new when retrieving missing events from federated servers, causing them to appear at the bottom of the timeline in clients
