# Changelog

## Dendrite 0.8.5 (2022-05-13)

### Features

* New living documentation available at <https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/>, including new installation instructions
* The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.2

### Fixes

* Monolith deployments will no longer panic at startup if given a config file that does not include the `internal_api` and `external_api` options
* State resolution v2 now correctly identifies other events related to power events, which should fix some event auth issues
* The latest events updater will no longer implicitly trust the new forward extremities when calculating the current room state, which may help to avoid some state resets
* The one-time key count is now correctly returned in `/sync` even if the request otherwise timed out, which should reduce the chance that unnecessary one-time keys will be uploaded by clients
* The `create-account` tool should now work properly when the database is configured using the global connection pool

## Dendrite 0.8.4 (2022-05-10)

### Fixes

* Fixes a regression introduced in the previous version where appservices, push and phone-home statistics would not work over plain HTTP
* Adds missing indexes to the sync API output events table, which should significantly improve `/sync` performance and reduce database CPU usage
* Building Dendrite with the `bimg` thumbnailer should now work again (contributed by [database64128](https://github.com/database64128))

## Dendrite 0.8.3 (2022-05-09)

### Features

* Open registration is now harder to enable, which should reduce the chance that Dendrite servers will be used to conduct spam or abuse attacks
  * Dendrite will only enable open registration if you pass the `--really-enable-open-registration` command line flag at startup
  * If open registration is enabled but this command line flag is not passed, Dendrite will fail to start up
* Dendrite now supports phone-home statistic reporting
  * These statistics include things like the number of registered and active users, some configuration options and platform/environment details, to help us to understand how Dendrite is used
  * This is not enabled by default â€” it must be enabled in the `global.report_stats` section of the config file
* Monolith installations can now be configured with a single global database connection pool (in `global.database` in the config) rather than having to configure each component separately
  * This also means that you no longer need to balance connection counts between different components, as they will share the same larger pool
  * Specific components can override the global database settings by specifying their own `database` block
  * To use only the global pool, you must configure `global.database` and then remove the `database` block from all of the component sections of the config file
* A new admin API endpoint `/_dendrite/admin/evacuateRoom/{roomID}` has been added, allowing server admins to forcefully part all local users from a given room
* The sync notifier now only loads members for the relevant rooms, which should reduce CPU usage and load on the database
* A number of component interfaces have been refactored for cleanliness and developer ease
* Event auth errors in the log should now be much more useful, including the reason for the event failures
* The forward extremity calculation in the roomserver has been simplified
* A new index has been added to the one-time keys table in the keyserver which should speed up key count lookups

### Fixes

* Dendrite will no longer process events for rooms where there are no local users joined, which should help to reduce CPU and RAM usage
* A bug has been fixed in event auth when changing the user levels in `m.room.power_levels` events
* Usernames should no longer be duplicated when no room name is set
* Device display names should now be correctly propagated over federation
* A panic when uploading cross-signing signatures has been fixed
* Presence is now correctly limited in `/sync` based on the filters
* The presence stream position returned by `/sync` will now be correct if no presence events were returned
* The media `/config` endpoint will no longer return a maximum upload size field if it is configured to be unlimited in the Dendrite config
* The server notices room will no longer produce "User is already joined to the room" errors
* Consumer errors will no longer flood the logs during a graceful shutdown
* Sync API and federation API consumers will no longer unnecessarily query added state events matching the one in the output event
* The Sync API will no longer unnecessarily track invites for remote users

## Dendrite 0.8.2 (2022-04-27)

### Features

* Lazy-loading has been added to the `/sync` endpoint, which should speed up syncs considerably
* Filtering has been added to the `/messages` endpoint
* The room summary now contains "heroes" (up to 5 users in the room) for clients to display when no room name is set
* The existing lazy-loading caches will now be used by `/messages` and `/context` so that member events will not be sent to clients more times than necessary
* The account data stream now uses the provided filters
* The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.0
* The `/state` and `/state_ids` endpoints will now return `M_NOT_FOUND` for rejected events

* Dendrite should now be able to run as a Windows service under Service Control Manager

### Fixes

* Fictitious presence updates will no longer be created for users which have not sent us presence updates, which should speed up complete syncs considerably
* Uploading cross-signing device signatures should now be more reliable, fixing a number of bugs with cross-signing
* All account data should now be sent properly on a complete sync, which should eliminate problems with client settings or key backups appearing to be missing
* Account data will now be limited correctly on incremental syncs, returning the stream position of the most recent update rather than the latest stream position
* Account data will not be sent for parted rooms, which should reduce the number of left/forgotten rooms reappearing in clients as empty rooms
* The TURN username hash has been fixed which should help to resolve some problems when using TURN for voice calls (contributed by [fcwoknhenuxdfiyv](https://github.com/fcwoknhenuxdfiyv))
* Push rules can no longer be modified using the account data endpoints
* Querying account availability should now work properly in polylith deployments
* A number of bugs with sync filters have been fixed
* A default sync filter will now be used if the request contains a filter ID that does not exist
* The `pushkey_ts` field is now using seconds instead of milliseconds
* A race condition when gracefully shutting down has been fixed, so JetStream should no longer cause the process to exit before other Dendrite components are finished shutting down

* The EDU server component has now been removed, with the work being moved to more relevant components

### Fixes

* It is now possible to set the `power_level_content_override` when creating a room to include power levels over 100
* `/send_join` and `/state` responses will now not unmarshal the JSON twice
* The stream event consumer for push notifications will no longer request membership events that are irrelevant

## Dendrite 0.6.5 (2022-03-04)

### Features

* Early support for push notifications has been added, with support for push rules, pushers, HTTP push gateways and the `/notifications` endpoint (contributions by [danpe](https://github.com/danpe), [PiotrKozimor](https://github.com/PiotrKozimor) and [tommie](https://github.com/tommie))
* Spaces Summary (MSC2946) is now correctly supported (when `msc2946` is enabled in the config)

* Accounts now have an optional account type field, allowing admin accounts to be created
* Server notices are now supported
* Refactored the user API storage to deduplicate a significant amount of code, as well as merging both user API databases into a single database
  * The account database is now used for all user API storage and the device database is now obsolete
  * For some installations that have separate account and device databases, this may result in access tokens being revoked and client sessions being logged out â€” users may need to log in again
  * The above can be avoided by moving the `device_devices` table into the account database manually
* Guest registration can now be separately disabled with the new `client_api.guests_disabled` configuration option
* Outbound connections now obey proxy settings from the environment, deprecating the `federation_api.proxy_outbound` configuration options

* The key change consumers have now been converted to use native NATS code rather than a wrapper
* Go 1.16 is now the minimum supported version for Dendrite

### Fixes

* Local clients should now be notified correctly of invites
* The roomserver input API now has more time to process events, particularly when fetching missing events or state, which should fix a number of errors from expired contexts
* Fixed a panic that could happen due to a closed channel in the roomserver input API
* Logging in with uppercase usernames from old installations is now supported again (contributed by [hoernschen](https://github.com/hoernschen))

* The roomserver is now responsible for fetching missing events and state instead of the federation API
  * Removes a number of race conditions between the federation API and roomserver, which reduces duplicate work and overall lowers CPU usage
* The roomserver input API is now strictly ordered with support for asynchronous requests, smoothing out incoming federation significantly
* Consolidated the federation API, federation sender and signing key server into a single component
  * If multiple databases are used, tables for the federation sender and signing key server should be merged into the federation API database (table names have not changed)
* Device list synchronisation is now database-backed rather than using the now-removed Kafka logs

* A crash on concurrent map read/writes has been fixed in the stream token code
* The roomserver input API no longer starts more worker goroutines than needed
* The roomserver no longer uses the request context for queued tasks which could lead to send requests failing to be processed
* A new index has been added to the sync API current state table, which improves lookup performance significantly
* The client API `/joined_rooms` endpoint no longer incorrectly returns `null` if there are 0 rooms joined
* The roomserver will now query appservices when looking up a local room alias that isn't known
* The check on registration for appservice-exclusive namespaces has been fixed

## Dendrite 0.3.3 (2020-12-09)

### Features

* Federation sender should now use considerably less CPU cycles and RAM when sending events into large rooms
* The roomserver now uses considerably less CPU cycles by not calculating event IDs so often
* Experimental support for [MSC2836](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2836) (threading) has been merged
* Dendrite will no longer hold federation HTTP connections open unnecessarily, which should help to reduce ambient CPU/RAM usage and hold fewer long-term file descriptors

### Fixes

* A bug in the latest event updater has been fixed, which should prevent the roomserver from losing forward extremities in some rare cases
* A panic has been fixed when federation is disabled (contributed by [kraem](https://github.com/kraem))
* The response format of the `/joined_members` endpoint has been fixed (contributed by [alexkursell](https://github.com/alexkursell))

## Dendrite 0.3.2 (2020-12-02)

### Features

* Federation can now be disabled with the `global.disable_federation` configuration option

### Fixes

* The `"since"` parameter is now checked more thoroughly in the sync API, which led to a bug that could cause forgotten rooms to reappear (contributed by [kaniini](https://github.com/kaniini))
* The polylith now proxies signing key requests through the federation sender correctly
* The code for checking if remote servers are allowed to see events now no longer wastes CPU time retrieving irrelevant state events

## Dendrite 0.3.1 (2020-11-20)

### Features

* Memory optimisation by reference passing, significantly reducing the number of allocations and duplication in memory
* A hook API has been added for experimental MSCs, with an early implementation of MSC2836
* The last seen timestamp and IP address are now updated automatically when calling `/sync`
* The last seen timestamp and IP address are now reported in `/_matrix/client/r0/devices` (contributed by [alexkursell](https://github.com/alexkursell))
* An optional configuration option `sync_api.real_ip_header` has been added for specifying which HTTP header contains the real client IP address (for if Dendrite is running behind a reverse HTTP proxy)
* Partial implementation of `/_matrix/client/r0/admin/whois` (contributed by [DavidSpenler](https://github.com/DavidSpenler))

### Fixes

* A concurrency bug has been fixed in the federation API that could cause Dendrite to crash
* The error when registering a username with invalid characters has been corrected (contributed by [bodqhrohro](https://github.com/bodqhrohro))

## Dendrite 0.3.0 (2020-11-16)

### Features

* Read receipts (both inbound and outbound) are now supported (contributed by [S7evinK](https://github.com/S7evinK))
* Forgetting rooms is now supported (contributed by [S7evinK](https://github.com/S7evinK))

### Fixes

* User accounts that contain the `=` character can now be registered
* Backfilling should now work properly on rooms with world-readable history visibility (contributed by [MayeulC](https://github.com/MayeulC))

* Some more client event fields have been marked as omit-when-empty (contributed by [S7evinK](https://github.com/S7evinK))
* The `build.sh` script has been updated to work properly on all POSIX platforms (contributed by [felix](https://github.com/felix))

## Dendrite 0.2.1 (2020-10-22)

### Fixes

* Forward extremities are now calculated using only references from other extremities, rather than including outliers, which should fix cases where state can become corrupted ([#1556](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1556))
* Old state events will no longer be processed by the sync API as new, which should fix some cases where clients incorrectly believe they have joined or left rooms ([#1548](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1548))
* More SQLite database locking issues have been resolved in the latest events updater ([#1554](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1554))
* Internal HTTP API calls are now made using H2C (HTTP/2) in polylith mode, mitigating some potential head-of-line blocking issues ([#1541](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1541))
* Roomserver output events no longer incorrectly flag state rewrites ([#1557](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1557))
* Notification levels are now parsed correctly in power level events ([gomatrixserverlib#228](https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/pull/228), contributed by [Pestdoktor](https://github.com/Pestdoktor))

## Dendrite 0.2.0 (2020-10-20)

### Important

* This release makes breaking changes for polylith deployments, since they now use the multi-personality binary rather than separate binary files
  * Users of polylith deployments should revise their setups to use the new binary - see the Features section below
* This release also makes breaking changes for Docker deployments, as are now publishing images to Docker Hub in separate repositories for monolith and polylith
  * New repositories are as follows: [matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith) and [matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith)
  * The new `latest` tag will be updated with the latest release, and new versioned tags, e.g. `v0.2.0`, will preserve specific release versions
  * [Sample Compose configs](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/tree/master/build/docker) have been updated - if you are running a Docker deployment, please review the changes
  * Images for the client API proxy and federation API proxy are no longer provided as they are unsupported - please use [nginx](docs/nginx/) (or another reverse proxy) instead

### Features

* Dendrite polylith deployments now use a special multi-personality binary, rather than separate binaries
  * This is cleaner, builds faster and simplifies deployment
  * The first command line argument states the component to run, e.g. `./dendrite-polylith-multi roomserver`
* Database migrations are now run at startup
* Invalid UTF-8 in requests is now rejected (contributed by [Pestdoktor](https://github.com/Pestdoktor))
* Fully read markers are now implemented in the client API (contributed by [Lesterpig](https://github.com/Lesterpig))
* Missing auth events are now retrieved from other servers in the room, rather than just the event origin
* `m.room.create` events are now validated properly when processing a `/send_join` response
* The roomserver now implements `KindOld` for handling historic events without them becoming forward extremity candidates, i.e. for backfilled or missing events

### Fixes

* State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically when dealing with large state sets
* The roomserver no longer processes outlier events if they are already known
* A SQLite locking issue in the previous events updater has been fixed
* The client API `/state` endpoint now correctly returns state after the leave event, if the user has left the room
* The client API `/createRoom` endpoint now sends cumulative state to the roomserver for the initial room events
* The federation API `/send` endpoint now correctly requests the entire room state from the roomserver when needed
* Some internal HTTP API paths have been fixed in the user API (contributed by [S7evinK](https://github.com/S7evinK))
* A race condition in the rate limiting code resulting in concurrent map writes has been fixed
* Each component now correctly starts a consumer/producer connection in monolith mode (when using Kafka)
* State resolution is no longer run for single trusted state snapshots that have been verified before
* A crash when rolling back the transaction in the latest events updater has been fixed
* Typing events are now ignored when the sender domain does not match the origin server
* Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors
* Recursion has been removed from the code path for retrieving missing events
* `QueryMissingAuthPrevEvents` now returns events that have no associated state as if they are missing
* Signing key fetchers no longer ignore keys for the local domain, if retrieving a key that is not known in the local config
* Federation timeouts have been adjusted so we don't give up on remote requests so quickly
* `create-account` no longer relies on the device database (contributed by [ThatNerdyPikachu](https://github.com/ThatNerdyPikachu))

### Known issues

* Old events can incorrectly appear in `/sync` as if they are new when retrieving missing events from federated servers, causing them to appear at the bottom of the timeline in clients
