# Preparing database storage

Dendrite uses SQL databases to store data. Depending on the database engine being used, you
may need to perform some manual steps outlined below.

## SQLite

SQLite deployments do not require manual database creation. Simply configure the database
filenames in the Dendrite configuration file and start Dendrite. The databases will be created
and populated automatically.

Note that Dendrite **cannot share a single SQLite database across multiple components**. Each
component must be configured with its own SQLite database filename.

### Connection strings

Connection strings for SQLite databases take the following forms:

* Current working directory path: `file:dendrite_component.db`
* Full specified path: `file:///path/to/dendrite_component.db`

## PostgreSQL

Dendrite can automatically populate the database with the relevant tables and indexes, but
it is not capable of creating the databases themselves. You will need to create the databases
manually.

At this point, you can choose to either use a single database for all Dendrite components,
or you can run each component with its own separate database:

* **Single database**: You will need to create a single PostgreSQL database. Monolith deployments
  can use a single global connection pool, which makes updating the configuration file much easier.
  Only one database connection string to manage and likely simpler to back up the database. All
  components will be sharing the same database resources (CPU, RAM, storage).

* **Separate databases**: You will need to create a separate PostgreSQL database for each
  component. You will need to configure each component that has storage in the Dendrite
  configuration file with its own connection parameters. Allows running a different database engine
  for each component on a different machine if needs be, each with their own CPU, RAM and storage â€”
  almost certainly overkill unless you are running a very large Dendrite deployment.

For either configuration, you will want to:

1. Configure a role (with a username and password) which Dendrite can use to connect to the
   database;
2. Create the database(s) themselves, ensuring that the Dendrite role has privileges over them.
   As Dendrite will create and manage the database tables, indexes and sequences by itself, the
   Dendrite role must have suitable privileges over the database.

### Connection strings

The format of connection strings for PostgreSQL databases is described in the [PostgreSQL libpq manual](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING). Note that Dendrite only
supports the "Connection URIs" format and **will not** work with the "Keyword/Value Connection
string" format.

Example supported connection strings take the format:

* `postgresql://user:pass@hostname/database?options=...`
* `postgres://user:pass@hostname/database?options=...`

If you need to disable SSL/TLS on the database connection, you may need to append `?sslmode=disable` to the end of the connection string.

### Role creation

Create a role which Dendrite can use to connect to the database, choosing a new password when
prompted. On macOS, you may need to omit the `sudo -u postgres` from the below instructions.

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser -P dendrite
```

### Single database creation

Create the database itself, using the `dendrite` role from above:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createdb -O dendrite dendrite
```

### Multiple database creation

The following eight components require a database. In this example they will be named:

| Appservice API | `dendrite_appservice`    |
| Federation API | `dendrite_federationapi` |
| Media API      | `dendrite_mediaapi`      |
| MSCs           | `dendrite_mscs`          |
| Roomserver     | `dendrite_roomserver`    |
| Sync API       | `dendrite_syncapi`       |
| Key server     | `dendrite_keyserver`     |
| User API       | `dendrite_userapi`       |

... therefore you will need to create eight different databases:

```bash
for i in appservice federationapi mediaapi mscs roomserver syncapi keyserver userapi; do
    sudo -u postgres createdb -O dendrite dendrite_$i
done
```
