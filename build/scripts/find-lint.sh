# Runs the linters against dendrite

# The linters can take a lot of resources and are slow, so they can be
# configured using the following environment variables:
#
# - `DENDRITE_LINT_CONCURRENCY` - number of concurrent linters to run,
#   golangci-lint defaults this to NumCPU
# - `GOGC` - how often to perform garbage collection during golangci-lint runs.
#   Essentially a ratio of memory/speed. See https://golangci-lint.run/usage/performance/#memory-usage
#   for more info.
