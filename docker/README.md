# dendrite in docker

## Building images

At the top level of the dendrite repository there is a `docker-build.sh` script that builds all necessary docker images for running the `docker-compose.yaml` deployment here.

## Configuration

There are a few aspects to configuration of a dendrite deployment for docker-compose:

* `dendrite-config.yaml`
* certificates
* environment variables

### `dendrite-config.yaml`

An example `dendrite-config.yaml` is included here. Modify the `server_name` as needed but the rest should just work.

### certificates

Certificates can be generated by running `generate-keys.sh` that is in this directory.

### Environment variables

The following environment variables **MUST** be set when running `docker-compose` in order for everything to work properly:

* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - set this to something secret

Note: `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` is set to `dendrite` in the `.env` file in this directory so that containers will be called `dendrite_<service>_1`.

## Running

From this directory, run `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOURSECRET docker-compose up -d`. The client-api-proxy will be exposed on `https://0.0.0.0:8443` and the federation-api-proxy on `https://0.0.0.0:8449`.

## Create accounts

Use the `create-account` tool and point it at `postgres://postgres:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost/dendrite_account?sslmode=disable` to create accounts.
