# Blacklisted due to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/942
The only membership state included in a gapped incremental sync is for senders in the timeline

# Flakey
AS-ghosted users can use rooms themselves
AS-ghosted users can use rooms via AS
Events in rooms with AS-hosted room aliases are sent to AS server
Inviting an AS-hosted user asks the AS server
Accesing an AS-hosted room alias asks the AS server
If user leaves room, remote user changes device and rejoins we see update in /sync and /keys/changes

# This will fail in HTTP API mode, so blacklisted for now
If a device list update goes missing, the server resyncs on the next one

# Might be a bug in the test because leaves do appear :-(
Leaves are present in non-gapped incremental syncs

# We don't have any state to calculate m.room.guest_access when accepting invites
Guest users can accept invites to private rooms over federation
# Below test was passing for the wrong reason, failing correctly since #2858
New federated private chats get full presence information (SYN-115)
If a device list update goes missing, the server resyncs on the next one
# You'll be shocked to discover this is flakey too

Inbound /v1/send_join rejects joins from other servers

# For notifications extension on iOS

/event/ does not allow access to events before the user joined

# Failing after recent updates with presence

Newly joined room includes presence in incremental sync
User sees their own presence in a sync
User is offline if they set_presence=offline in their sync
User sees updates to presence from other users in the incremental sync.
