// An OutputRoomEvent is written when the roomserver receives a new event.

// consumer to construct the current state of the room and the state before the
// event.

// When we talk about state in a matrix room we are talking about the state
// after a list of events. The current state is the state after the latest
// event IDs in the room. The state before an event is the state after its
// prev_events.

	// view of the current state of the room.

	// current state using the delta supplied in AddsStateEventIDs and
	// RemovesStateEventIDs.

	// current state. The StateBeforeAddsEventIDs and StateBeforeRemovesEventIDs
	// delta is applied after the AddsStateEventIDs and RemovesStateEventIDs.

	// which users and servers are allowed to see the event. This information
	// is needed to apply the history visibility rules and to tell which
	// servers we need to push events to over federation.
