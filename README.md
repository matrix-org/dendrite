Dendrite will be a second-generation Matrix homeserver written in Go.

It's still very much a work in progress, but installation instructions can be
found in [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md). It is not recommended to use Dendrite as a
production homeserver at this time.

An overview of the design can be found in [DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

# Discussion

For questions about Dendrite we have a dedicated room on Matrix
[#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org). Development
discussion should happen in
[#dendrite-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org).

# Progress

There's plenty still to do to make Dendrite usable! We're tracking progress in a
[project board](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/projects/2).
