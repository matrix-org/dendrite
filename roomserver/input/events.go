		// request for a user. For example if a user was invited to a public
		// room and they joined the room at the same time as the invite was sent.
		// The other way this could plausibly happen is if an invite raced with
		// a kick. For example if a user was kicked from a room in error and in
		// response someone else in the room re-invited them then it is possible
		// for the invite request to race with the leave event so that the
		// target receives invite before it learns that it has been kicked.
		// There are a few ways this could be plausibly handled in the roomserver.
		// 1) Store the invite, but mark it as retired. That will result in the
		//    permanent rejection of that invite event. So even if the target
		//    user leaves the room and the invite is retransmitted it will be
		//    ignored. However a new invite with a new event ID would still be
		//    accepted.
		// 2) Silently discard the invite event. This means that if the event
		//    was retransmitted at a later date after the target user had left
		//    the room we would accept the invite. However since we hadn't told
		//    the sending server that the invite had been discarded it would
		//    have no reason to attempt to retry.
		// 3) Signal the sending server that the user is already joined to the
		//    room.
		// For now we will implement option 2. Since in the abesence of a retry
		// mechanism it will be equivalent to option 1, and we don't have a
		// signalling mechanism to implement option 3.
