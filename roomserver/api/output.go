	// This event is emitted when a redaction has been 'validated' (meaning both the redaction and the event to redact are known).
	// Redaction validation happens when the roomserver receives either:
	// - A redaction for which we have the event to redact.
	// - Any event for which we have a redaction.
	// When the roomserver receives an event, it will check against the redactions table to see if there is a matching redaction
	// for the event. If there is, it will mark the redaction as validated and emit this event. In the common case of a redaction
	// happening after receiving the event to redact, the roomserver will emit a OutputTypeNewRoomEvent of m.room.redaction
	// immediately followed by a OutputTypeRedactedEvent. In the uncommon case of receiving the redaction BEFORE the event to redact,
	// the roomserver will emit a OutputTypeNewRoomEvent of the event to redact immediately followed by a OutputTypeRedactedEvent.
	//
	// In order to honour redactions correctly, downstream components must ignore m.room.redaction events emitted via OutputTypeNewRoomEvent.
	// When downstream components receive an OutputTypeRedactedEvent they must:
	// - Pull out the event to redact from the database. They should have this because the redaction is validated.
	// - Redact the event and set the corresponding `unsigned` fields to indicate it as redacted.
