The number of tools for statically checking Go source for errors and warnings
is impressive.

This is a tool that concurrently runs a whole bunch of those linters and
normalises their output to a standard format:

    <file>:<line>:[<column>]: <message> (<linter>)

eg.

    stutter.go:9::warning: unused global variable unusedGlobal (varcheck)
    stutter.go:12:6:warning: exported type MyStruct should have comment or be unexported (golint)

It is intended for use with editor/IDE integration.

Additional linters can be added through the command line with `--linter=NAME:COMMAND:PATTERN` (see [below](#details)).

## Configuration file

gometalinter now supports a JSON configuration file which can be loaded via
`--config=<file>`. The format of this file is determined by the `Config` struct
in [config.go](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter/blob/master/config.go).

The configuration file mostly corresponds to command-line flags, with the following exceptions:

- Linters defined in the configuration file will overlay existing definitions, not replace them.
- "Enable" defines the exact set of linters that will be enabled (default
  linters are disabled). `--help` displays the list of default linters with the exact names
  you must use.

Here is an example configuration file:

```json
{
  "Enable": ["deadcode", "unconvert"]
}
```

### Adding Custom linters

Linters can be added and customized from the config file using the `Linters` field.
Linters supports the following fields:

* `Command` - the path to the linter binary and any default arguments
* `Pattern` - a regular expression used to parse the linter output
* `IsFast` - if the linter should be run when the `--fast` flag is used
* `PartitionStrategy` - how paths args should be passed to the linter command:
  * `directories` - call the linter once with a list of all the directories
  * `files` - call the linter once with a list of all the files
  * `packages` - call the linter once with a list of all the package paths
  * `files-by-package` - call the linter once per package with a list of the
    files in the package.
  * `single-directory` - call the linter once per directory

The config for default linters can be overridden by using the name of the
linter.

Additional linters can be configured via the command line using the format
`NAME:COMMAND:PATTERN`.

Example:

```
$ gometalinter --linter='vet:go tool vet -printfuncs=Infof,Debugf,Warningf,Errorf:PATH:LINE:MESSAGE' .
```

## Installing

There are two options for installing gometalinter.

1. Install a stable version, eg. `go get -u gopkg.in/alecthomas/gometalinter.v1`.
   I will generally only tag a new stable version when it has passed the Travis
  regression tests. The downside is that the binary will be called `gometalinter.v1`.
2. Install from HEAD with: `go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter`.
   This has the downside that changes to gometalinter may break.

## Comment directives

gometalinter supports suppression of linter messages via comment directives. The
form of the directive is:

```
// nolint[: <linter>[, <linter>, ...]]
```

Suppression works in the following way:

1. Line-level suppression

    A comment directive suppresses any linter messages on that line.

    eg. In this example any messages for `a := 10` will be suppressed and errcheck
    messages for `defer r.Close()` will also be suppressed.

    ```go
    a := 10 // nolint
    a = 2
    defer r.Close() // nolint: errcheck
    ```

2. Statement-level suppression

    A comment directive at the same indentation level as a statement it
    immediately precedes will also suppress any linter messages in that entire
    statement.

    eg. In this example all messages for `SomeFunc()` will be suppressed.

    ```go
    // nolint
    func SomeFunc() {
    }
    ```

Implementation details: gometalinter now performs parsing of Go source code,
to extract linter directives and associate them with line ranges. To avoid
unnecessary processing, parsing is on-demand: the first time a linter emits a
message for a file, that file is parsed for directives.

## Quickstart

Install gometalinter (see above).

Install all known linters:

```
$ gometalinter --install
Installing:
  structcheck
  maligned
  nakedret
  deadcode
  gocyclo
  ineffassign
  dupl
  golint
  gotype
  goimports
  errcheck
  varcheck
  interfacer
  goconst
  gosimple
  staticcheck
  unparam
  unused
  misspell
  lll
  gas
  safesql
```

Run it:

```
$ cd example
$ gometalinter ./...
stutter.go:13::warning: unused struct field MyStruct.Unused (structcheck)
stutter.go:9::warning: unused global variable unusedGlobal (varcheck)
stutter.go:12:6:warning: exported type MyStruct should have comment or be unexported (golint)
stutter.go:16:6:warning: exported type PublicUndocumented should have comment or be unexported (golint)
stutter.go:8:1:warning: unusedGlobal is unused (deadcode)
stutter.go:12:1:warning: MyStruct is unused (deadcode)
stutter.go:16:1:warning: PublicUndocumented is unused (deadcode)
stutter.go:20:1:warning: duplicateDefer is unused (deadcode)
stutter.go:21:15:warning: error return value not checked (defer a.Close()) (errcheck)
stutter.go:22:15:warning: error return value not checked (defer a.Close()) (errcheck)
stutter.go:27:6:warning: error return value not checked (doit()           // test for errcheck) (errcheck)
stutter.go:29::error: unreachable code (vet)
stutter.go:26::error: missing argument for Printf("%d"): format reads arg 1, have only 0 args (vet)
```


Gometalinter also supports the commonly seen `<path>/...` recursive path
format. Note that this can be *very* slow, and you may need to increase the linter `--deadline` to allow linters to complete.

## FAQ

### Exit status

gometalinter sets two bits of the exit status to indicate different issues:

| Bit | Meaning
|-----|----------
| 0   | A linter generated an issue.
| 1   | An underlying error occurred; eg. a linter failed to execute. In this situation a warning will also be displayed.

eg. linter only = 1, underlying only = 2, linter + underlying = 3

### What's the best way to use `gometalinter` in CI?

There are two main problems running in a CI:

1. <s>Linters break, causing `gometalinter --install --update` to error</s> (this is no longer an issue as all linters are vendored).
2. `gometalinter` adds a new linter.

I have solved 1 by vendoring the linters.

For 2, the best option is to disable all linters, then explicitly enable the
ones you want:

    gometalinter --disable-all --enable=errcheck --enable=vet --enable=vetshadow ...

### How do I make `gometalinter` work with Go 1.5 vendoring?

`gometalinter` has a `--vendor` flag that just sets `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1`, however the
underlying tools must support it. Ensure that all of the linters are up to date and built with Go 1.5
(`gometalinter --install --force`) then run `gometalinter --vendor .`. That should be it.

### Why does `gometalinter --install` install a fork of gocyclo?

I forked `gocyclo` because the upstream behaviour is to recursively check all
subdirectories even when just a single directory is specified. This made it
unusably slow when vendoring. The recursive behaviour can be achieved with
gometalinter by explicitly specifying `<path>/...`. There is a
[pull request](https://github.com/fzipp/gocyclo/pull/1) open.

### Gometalinter is not working

That's more of a statement than a question, but okay.

Sometimes gometalinter will not report issues that you think it should. There
are three things to try in that case:

#### 1. Update to the latest build of gometalinter and all linters

    go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter
    gometalinter --install

If you're lucky, this will fix the problem.

#### 2. Analyse the debug output

If that doesn't help, the problem may be elsewhere (in no particular order):

1. Upstream linter has changed its output or semantics.
2. gometalinter is not invoking the tool correctly.
3. gometalinter regular expression matches are not correct for a linter.
4. Linter is exceeding the deadline.

To find out what's going on run in debug mode:

    gometalinter --debug

This will show all output from the linters and should indicate why it is
failing.

#### 3. Report an issue.

Failing all else, if the problem looks like a bug please file an issue and
include the output of `gometalinter --debug`.

### How do I filter issues between two git refs?

[revgrep](https://github.com/bradleyfalzon/revgrep) can be used to filter the output of `gometalinter`
to show issues on lines that have changed between two git refs, such as unstaged changes, changes in
`HEAD` vs `master` and between `master` and `origin/master`. See the project's documentation and `-help`
usage for more information.

```
go get -u github.com/bradleyfalzon/revgrep/...
gometalinter |& revgrep               # If unstaged changes or untracked files, those issues are shown.
gometalinter |& revgrep               # Else show issues in the last commit.
gometalinter |& revgrep master        # Show issues between master and HEAD (or any other reference).
gometalinter |& revgrep origin/master # Show issues that haven't been pushed.
```

## Checkstyle XML format

`gometalinter` supports [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/)
compatible XML output format. It is triggered with `--checkstyle` flag:

	gometalinter --checkstyle

Checkstyle format can be used to integrate gometalinter with Jenkins CI with the
help of [Checkstyle Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Checkstyle+Plugin).
