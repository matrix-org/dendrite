# Continuous Integration

This is a folder containing files necessary for Dendrite's Continuous
Integration. Currently this folder only contains files that are necessary to
run a live version of Dendrite. All of our continuous integration is done using
[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com) - the pipeline for which can be found in
Matrix.org's [pipelines repository](https://github.com/matrix-org/pipelines).
